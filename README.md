<h1>Address book web app</h1>

<p>The purpose of this app is to get real practice in the development of the complete web application based on MERN stack.</p>

<p>Functionally wise, the application is a simple address book with the possibility to search and sort contacts depending on user's need.</p>

<p>Web app provides standard functionality with the possibility to create, view, edit and delete contacts.</p>

<p>Search function immediately filters all the contacts and shows only those, which contain search phase in any contacts' fields.</p>

<p>Sorting function provides user the possibility to sort contacts according to contacts' name, familyname, number of previous searches / likes or its creation date.</p>

<p>When user clicks 'DETAILS' button, its likes counter goes 1 up. User also can 'like' any contact manually.</p>

<p>'SHARE' button copies all the contact details to the clipboard.</p>
